# R for Research Scientists

This booklet is the result of my work with the [Social Cognition for Social Justice lab](https://henneslab.wixsite.com/scs). It was developed in response to questions I was getting from students; both grad students that were making software design decisions, and undergraduates who were using things like version control for the first time. Although many tutorials and resources exist for these topics, there was not a single source that I thought covered just enough material to build up to the workflow used by the lab without extraneous detail. 

## Topics Covered:
1. [R Language and Environment](http://project.nicole-brewer.com/r-for-research-scientists/r-language-and-environment.html)
2. [Git and Github](http://project.nicole-brewer.com/r-for-research-scientists/git.html)
3. [R Packages](http://project.nicole-brewer.com/r-for-research-scientists/pack.html)
4. [Unit Testing](http://project.nicole-brewer.com/r-for-research-scientists/test.html)
5. [Documentation](http://project.nicole-brewer.com/r-for-research-scientists/doc.html)
6. [Development Workflow](http://project.nicole-brewer.com/r-for-research-scientists/putting-it-all-together.html)
7. [Publication](http://project.nicole-brewer.com/r-for-research-scientists/publications.html)
