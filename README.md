# R for Research Scientists

There are already many great tutorials out there for building packages in R, but they are generally too comprehensive, and cater to project administrators. This book is intended for researchers who contriubute code to an R project, and leaves out details irrelevant to this audience.



## Topics Covered:

1. Using Git in RStudio
2. R Packages
3. Writing Unit Tests
4. Writing Documentation
5. A Comprehensive Workflow

This tutorial is built with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
