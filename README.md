# R for Research Scientists

There are already many great tutorials out there for building packages in R, but they are generally too comprehensive, and cater to project administrators. This book is intended for researchers who contriubute code to an R project, and leaves out details irrelevant to this audience. If you *are* the administrator for you project or you just want to know more about what's going on behind the hood, there is a section dedicated to helpful resources.

## Topics Covered:

1. Using Git in R
2. Writing Unit Tests
3. Writing Documentation

This tutorial is built with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).
