# Putting It All Together: The Workflow

To contribute to a project, we have to interact with Git, Github, documentation, and our package all in one session.

1. `git pull upstream master`
2. make one incremental change and verify that your code still runs
3. Add roxygen comments to your .R files
5. `devtools::document()` to automatically turn comments into Rd files
3. `devtools::check()` and fix any errors given
4. Repeat `devtools::check()` until there aren't any more errors
3. make a commit with an informative title
4. `git push origin master`

To play around with the package from the user standpoint, we must load it with `devtools::install()`
